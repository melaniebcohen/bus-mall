#### Day 11 | Monday, December 18
Covered the following in class:
- Final Project Overview
- Audio & Video
- Bus Mall Project

**Challenges**
Brian said that the Bus Mall assignment would likely be easier than Salmon Cookies, but that was not the case for me. This was really difficult and I feel like my solution is very "hacky".

**Overcoming Challenges**
Michael gave me a tip for the event listener that I would not have gotten on my own because I was completely lost. That really helped and I was able to build from there. The rest of it was just Google and being stubborn, I guess?
