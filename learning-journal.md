#### Day 11 | Monday, December 18
Covered the following in class:
- Final Project Overview
- Audio & Video
- Bus Mall Project

**Challenges**

Brian said that the Bus Mall assignment would likely be easier than Salmon Cookies, but that was not the case for me. This was really difficult and I feel like my solution is very "hacky".

**Overcoming Challenges**

Michael gave me a tip for the event listener that I would not have gotten on my own because I was completely lost. That really helped and I was able to build from there. The rest of it was just Google and being stubborn, I guess?

#### Day 12 | Tuesday, December 19
Covered the following in class:
- Code Review
- HTML5 Canvas
- Libraries

**Challenges**

After code review this morning, I refactored several areas of my code. I also fixed a bug that caused the last click not to be counted, which took a lot more time than it probably should have. Also figuring out the arrays for the charts was harder than I anticipated.

**Overcoming Challenges**

The chartJS documentation really helped, as well as continuing to Google problems as I encounter them. I do feel like I'm starting to get a slightly better grasp on events, which is good.

#### Day 13 | Wednesday, December 20
Covered the following in class:
- Persistence/Local Storage
- JSON

**Challenges**

This was brutal. But I also should have read the assignment more clearly before jumping in. I gave myself a lot of unnecessary work...

**Overcoming Challenges**

Well, understanding the assignment more clearly from Michael definitely helped. And knowing that I was doing a lot of unnecessary extra work. Once I figured that out, it was fairly straightforward... until I then attempted the stretch goal again. And failed. Oh well, I do think that it helped me better understand the material so that's good.

#### Day 14 | Thursday, December 21
Covered the following in class:
- 301 Preview
- Final Project

**Challenges**

I didn't work much on Bus Mall today, but working on the data structure based on a large data file for the final project was difficult.

**Overcoming Challenges**

Michelle helped me figure out the data and that's really exciting. The biggest challenge at this point is figuring out how to divvy up the work.

#### Day 15 | Friday, December 22
Covered the following in class:
- 201 Recap
- Final Project

**Challenges**

I worked on the Bus Mall project last night and got it to a point that I'm happy with. I figured out how to add a second set of data for the number of views using a line graph on top of a bar chart. Wasn't easy, but I'm glad I figured it out.

**Overcoming Challenges**

Most of my challenges are now relating to the final project. We're trying to determine everyone's strengths, their availability over the next week, and how we'll divvy out work. Looking forward to seeing how everything progresses.
