#### Day 11 | Monday, December 18
Covered the following in class:
- Final Project Overview
- Audio & Video
- Bus Mall Project

**Challenges**

Brian said that the Bus Mall assignment would likely be easier than Salmon Cookies, but that was not the case for me. This was really difficult and I feel like my solution is very "hacky".

**Overcoming Challenges**

Michael gave me a tip for the event listener that I would not have gotten on my own because I was completely lost. That really helped and I was able to build from there. The rest of it was just Google and being stubborn, I guess?

#### Day 12 | Tuesday, December 19
Covered the following in class:
- Code Review
- HTML5 Canvas
- Libraries

**Challenges**

After code review this morning, I refactored several areas of my code. I also fixed a bug that caused the last click not to be counted, which took a lot more time than it probably should have. Also figuring out the arrays for the charts was harder than I anticipated.

**Overcoming Challenges**

The chartJS documentation really helped, as well as continuing to Google problems as I encounter them. I do feel like I'm starting to get a slightly better grasp on events, which is good.

#### Day 13 | Tuesday, December 20
Covered the following in class:
- Persistence/Local Storage
- JSON

**Challenges**

This was brutal. But I also should have read the assignment more clearly before jumping in. I gave myself a lot of unnecessary work...

**Overcoming Challenges**

Well, understanding the assignment more clearly from Michael definitely helped. And knowing that I was doing a lot of unnecessary extra work. Once I figured that out, it was fairly straightforward... until I then attempted the stretch goal again. And failed. Oh well, I do think that it helped me better understand the material so that's good.
